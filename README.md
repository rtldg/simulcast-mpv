I was curious how easy it would be to sync two mpv players across the internet, even though it's' overengineering a solution to a not-very problem.
If one person pauses, then pause for the other person. Add in some ping calculation between clients.
That's basically what `simulcast-mpv` is.

This isn't bug-free and I probably won't do anything to fix that.

## Usage
**TL;DR:**
- [Download](https://github.com/rtldg/simulcast-mpv/releases) `simulcast-mpv`
- Run `simulcast-mpv`. It will install itself.
- Start mpv. It should just workâ„¢.
- (optional) Hit `a` once to show some info. Hit `a` a few times really fast to open up an input window for custom room codes. (Maybe you and your friend are watching the same thing, but your file names are different.)

The `simulcast-mpv` executable has 4 "modes":
- `simulcast-mpv`
    - This "installs" `simulcast-mpv` to your mpv scripts directory (`%APPDATA%\mpv\scripts` or `~/.config/mpv/scripts`). It also writes a helper lua script (`simulcast-mpv.lua`) to the directory.
- `simulcast-mpv client`
    - This is ran when mpv starts. It acts as a middle-man for sending pause/resume/seek messages between mpv and the relay server.
- `simulcast-mpv relay`
    - A websocket server
- `simulcast-mpv input-reader`
    - A popup command prompt window for inputting custom room codes.

## **TODO:**
- setup github actions to compile binaries x86_64 Windows, x86_64 Linux, 64-bit ARM Linux.
    - `cargo +1.75 build --release` (for Windows 7 support)
    - `cargo zigbuild --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.2.17`
- some logic bug somewhere for the pause/unpause on connect...
- Link to simulcast-mpv source-code (repository) in Hello message from the server?
    - log to stdout and log file...
- Make lots of IPC connections so we don't eat events from mpv when trying to query properties.
    - Drop `mpvipc` dependency if this is done?

## similar projects (for mpv)
- Syncplay: [website](https://syncplay.pl/) / [github](https://github.com/Syncplay/syncplay)
    - More feature-complete than `simulcast-mpv`.
- https://github.com/po5/groupwatch_sync
    - Manual groupwatch project.
- others? dunno...

## Environment variables / .env
`simulcast-mpv` allows environment variables and files to configure some of the settings.

client
- `SIMULCAST_RELAY_URL` / `--relay-url` (default `wss://..../`)
- `SIMULCAST_RELAY_ROOM` / `--relay-room` (default `abcd1234`)
- `SIMULCAST_CLIENT_SOCK` / `--client-sock` (passed by mpv to the simulcast-mpv executable)
server
- `SIMULCAST_BIND_ADDRESS` / `--bind-address` (default `127.0.0.1`)
- `SIMULCAST_BIND_PORT` / `--bind-port` (default `30777`)

Configuration files can be placed at
- `%APPDATA%\mpv\scripts\simulcast-mpv.env` (Windows)
- `~/.config/mpv/scripts/simulcast-mpv.env` (Unix)
- `$PWD/simulcast-mpv.env` (current directory AKA where mpv is started from) (Windows + Unix)

## Relay server privacy
Relay server "rooms" are public to anyone who joins using the same "room ID".

"Room IDs" are calculated client-side as `blake3_hash(filename + relay_room)` where `relay_room` is configurable with `SIMULCAST_RELAY_ROOM`/`--relay-room`.

This means the server cannot know which file you are playing unless the server already knows what the `filename + relay_room` combination is.
